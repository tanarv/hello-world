# hello-world
This repository, and correspondingly, this project; deals with my preliminary introduction to Github, the intellectual enterprises of Computer Science, and the art of programming.

I'm a student, first and foremost. I love learning - in an unnecessarily wide variety of stuff. This Github account will perhaps be my second brain for all things coding and CS, which I intend to do a lot of (hopefully). Amongst applied programming for IoT product development, hyperledger architecture for blockchain platforms, AR and VR application development, volumetric or holographic display creation, data science and analytics, or any other jargonized words you see turning up in the latest tech news, I duly hope this acts as my stepping stone.
